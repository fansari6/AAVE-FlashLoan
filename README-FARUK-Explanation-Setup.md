# Flash Loan Arbitrage Explanation:

This a smart contract that executes a flash loan using the Aave DeFi protocol performing Arbitrage. Aave is a DeFi lending protocol which offers a bunch of different services. First of all they custody ERC20 tokens and hold them in liquidity pools in order to make them available for borrowing by anyone. We will be working on Ethereum Sepolia testnet for this project.

For a Smart Contract in order to both request and receive a loan from Aave there is a requirement that we need to implement the IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver.sol or the IFlashLoanReceiver.sol interface in particular the executeOperation() function. The executeOperation() function is a function that's going to be invoked in our Smart Contract by AAVE V3 Protocol.

We're going to invoke The FlashLoanSimple function in the Aave pool contract passing in the token that we want to borrow and the amount. You'll notice this is FlashLoanSimple there's also a FlashLoan function and you'd use FlashLoan if you want to borrow several assets at a time some of tokens a b and c.

So at that point the pool contract will run some checks and then send the borrowed funds back to our flash loan contract at that point the executeOperation() function which we've defined will be invoked and here's where we'll run any custom logic that we want to do for example the Arbitrage operation so we may do some token swaps some buying and
selling via other exchanges such as uniswap Sushiswap or other decentralized exchanges.

After that's completed we will call the approve function on the borrowed ERC20 token for the amount borrowed plus the fee in order to allow Ave to pull back those funds at the conclusion of all these operations.

# Project Creation:

create a new hardhat project by typing:
npx hardhat

choose create a JavaScript Project

Install dependencies by running:
npm install

The next step is to install the Aave packages:
npm install @ave/core-v3

npm install dotenv

Create .env in the root of the project with the following 2 entries:
PRIVATE_KEY=<private key of your wallet>
INFURA_SEPOLIA_ENDPOINT=<infura sepolia endpoint>

# Code Explanation:

You have to implement the following interface in order for the contract to be the receiver of the loan:
import {FlashLoanSimpleReceiverBase} from "@aave/core-v3/contracts/flashloan/base/FlashLoanSimpleReceiverBase.sol";

This contains the executeOperation() function as well as two getter functions an address provider function ADDRESSES_PROVIDER() and a pool function POOL().

Last import is ERC20, we need this in order to call the approve function on the token that we're borrowing.

We will define the contract and we'll say FlashLoan we're going to inherit from FlashLoanSimpleReceiver.
